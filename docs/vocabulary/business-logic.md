# Business Logic
In its simplest non-technical form, Business logic is basically all the specific parts of the codebase that map 1:1 directly with a business/product requirement.
Here business requirement is not literally what the business asked us to do, but rather what rules/logic satisfies the product behaviour from a users point of view.

In the context of our journey here, business logic also means an [abstraction](./abstaction.md) layer.

And outcome of cleanly separating business logic from the rest of the code is:
> Any non-tech background business/management guy in then company can get _a sense_ of _every_ block of code in this layer.
