# A simple onion architecture model

**First of all, why this repo?**   
Well, to answer a very singular question: 
> How can we have codebases that are easy to maintain, extend and still have the ability to increase performance later when those scaling headaches come.

_Note: Most of the stuff I talk about here (specifically the specifics of how to design the codebase) are very specific to backend-engineering._
